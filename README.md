# Addressbook API
This is an address book application built using the FastAPI framework. It provides APIs to create, update, delete, and retrieve addresses. The addresses contain coordinates and are saved to an SQLite database. User can also retrieve addresses within a given distance from specific location coordinates. This application uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions and provides a standardized response structure.
